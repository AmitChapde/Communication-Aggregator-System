# Project Root

This repository contains three small services used as an example microservices layout:

- task-router-service
- delivery-service
- logging-service

Each service contains minimal scaffolding under `src/` and a `package.json` with a start script.

Create or install real dependencies (express, amqplib, DB drivers) and implement business logic as needed.
